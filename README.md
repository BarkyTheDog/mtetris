mtetris
=======

I acquired this code sometime in the early 1990s. I believe it originated with a DEC engineer in Japan (I was working for DEC at the time), and was originally called "dwtetris"; originally it seems to have been written for DECWindows. My "contributions" consist of some minor changes to make it compile on modern compilers, and some formatting for readability; otherwise it's relatively unimproved since I obtained it.

The game works and plays reasonably well (tested on OS X and Ubuntu). But, it's really just useful for software archaeology. Or grins.
